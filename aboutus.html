		 <h2>Our Story</h2> 
	<p> What started off as a hobby that three best friends shared, turned into a business venture. The Crafty Corner, established April 12th, 2021 started off as a social media page that the three friends used to share the art they created during the COVID-19 epidemic. We used art as a release during the very treacherous time of lockdown and curfew. Creating art allowed us to feel liberated, be expressive and distract ourselves especially during that time where it felt like things were not getting better.</p>
<p>Eventually, we began painting together with other members of our extended friend group, using online video conferencing apps where it allowed us to create our art all the while catching up and chatting with our friends.The pieces created during our 'Art and Yap' sessions were also shared on our social media where we got a decent amount of support where other people wanted to join our sessions. As a result of the great response we received, we decided to turn our page into a business page where we offered packages that included the tools needed to create art in our sessions and since then we have grown tremendously allowing us to since get a physical store and set up our online services.</p>
